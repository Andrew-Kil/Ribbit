# üê∏ Ribbit - (Reddit Clone)

This will be my first personal project as a 5.1 Full Stack Web Development fellow at Pursuit. Our objective is to create a clone of an existing full stack application. Out of:

- Tumblr
- Reddit
- Pinterest
- Evernote

I chose Reddit because it's an app that I use frequently and recreating it will be both challenging and exciting.

## Ideation:

---

- My initial plan of attack is to start by focusing on core components that encompass the general spectrum of the application so that in future versions, as I am focusing on creating and implementing additional functionalities, the application will have a strong foundation to minimize the amount of bugs for future, more specific features such as navigating to subribbits (subreddits) and possibly adding a dark mode setting.
