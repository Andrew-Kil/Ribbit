# üê∏ Ribbit - (Reddit Clone)

This will be my first personal project as a 5.1 Full Stack Web Development fellow at Pursuit. The objective is to, for our first time, create a clone of an existing full stack application. The choices were:

- Tumblr
- Reddit
- Pinterest
- Evernote

I chose Reddit because it's one of my favorite apps and I use it everyday. Building this project from the ground up will help me to better understand what each and every part of the application does.

## Ideation:

- My initial thought process is to start by identifying the core functionalities that I want to focus on.
- Create:
  - wireframes
  - database structure
  - state/routing/component structure
  - trello board
    - "Not Started"
    - "In Progress/Reviewed"
    - "Finished"
- Build out the core components of the applications
- Test components
- After satisfactory test results, work on more advanced features
