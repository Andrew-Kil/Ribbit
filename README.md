# üê∏ Ribbit - (Reddit Clone)

This is my first full stack personal project as a 5.1 Full Stack Web Development fellow at Pursuit. The objective is to create a clone of an existing full stack application. The choices are:
- Tumblr
- Reddit
- Pinterest
- Evernote

I chose Reddit because it's one of my favorite apps and I use it everyday. Building this project from the ground up will help me better understand what each and every part of the application does.
